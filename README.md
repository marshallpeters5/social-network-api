# Social Network API

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)

## Description

The Social Network API is a backend application that provides API endpoints for a social media platform. It allows users to interact with the platform by creating, updating, and deleting thoughts, reactions, and user accounts. The API is built using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, making it capable of handling large amounts of unstructured data.
